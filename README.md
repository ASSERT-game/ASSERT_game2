# ASSERT_game2

Tried to make a rendering engine, did not succeed. But learned plenty, z-buffers, UV maps, Barycentric coordinates.
Knowledge that will be helpful if I ever come back to this project or redo.

Most of the code was made using SDL and individually setting the pixels. Hence performance will be slow.
The plan was to be able to map textures onto the triangles, and so be able to create a primitive
rendering engine. The method used is rasterisation. I would have to rethink and do a big portion of the code
again to utilize barycentric coordinates which would make the usage of texture files much easier.

I derived most of the math myself, but realized that using regular coordinate system creates a harder system
to work in.
