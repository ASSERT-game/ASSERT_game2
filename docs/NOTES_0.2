Some research into the camera:

The camera seems inverted because it is facing the world in the opposite
direction. So something like moving left would be negative, because the camera
is facing the opposite direction, left is actually positive direction.

This can also be done by initializing the camera to:

[
	[-1, 0, 0, 0],
	[ 0, 1, 0, 0],
	[ 0, 0, 1, 0],
	[ 0, 0, 0, 1]
]

Or more formally, a 180 degree, pi radians, rotation across the y-axis:

[
	[ cos(A), 0, sin(A), 0],
	[      0, 1,      0, 0],
	[-sin(A), 0, cos(A), 0]
	[      0, 0,      0, 1],
]

Actually scratch that.
