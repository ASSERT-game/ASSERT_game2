Not sure why the code in the rasterizer.c function: convert_to_frame_of_reference
works quite exactly. It should only work on certain cases but not on all.
Next of all this projection business is pretty hard.

This is because when the vertices are behind the camera, they will still
get projected, but on the other side of the screen. Once would think
that a simple multiplication by -1 would work but it didn't. Couldn't quite
figure out why not either...
