Figuring out the color of each pixel in a rasterized triangle is more difficult
than anticipated. Method will end up involving barycentric coordinates. Other
methods I came up with seems a bit too messy, i.e. the logic of shading each
pixel was going to be too ingrained in the logic of rasterizing the triangle,
meaning that future changes to determine the "attributes" of the pixel were
going to prove difficult and unreadable.

Working on this engine has proven to be a bigger project than I can
take on. I knew of barycentric coordinates but didn't know how difficult
they would be implementing. However after fiddling with the math of them
they turned out be more simple, if not more elegant, solution to the problem
I had in mind. The problem with this is that I cannot keep diving to deep
into potential solutions because  I am unsure if they would work out.
Perhaps I need a better mathematical background. This however is more
a problem of creating heuristic methods to know which tool to use and when.
